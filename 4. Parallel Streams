Parallel Stream
uses Fork/Join framework 
- no. of threads created = no. of processors

stateful operations not work with parallel :
distinct(), sorted(), limit(), skip(), groupingBy(), partitioningBy() 

rest all can but

ðŸ§  Notes:

Stateful â‰  unsafe, but stateful operations may reduce parallel performance.
Some operations like collect() or reduce() can be safe or unsafe depending on how they're used (e.g., using synchronized collections or non-associative functions can make them unsafe).
forEach() is technically stateless, but if you perform side effects (e.g., modifying shared variables), it becomes unsafe in parallel.
